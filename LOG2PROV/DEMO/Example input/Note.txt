I noticed that when the workflow being executed runs the exhaustive memory operations, 
prometheus/cAdvisor crashes and temporarily stops recording performance data. 
This is why you will sometimes see the lines in the graphs ending abruptly before continuing again. 
I may have to decrease the intensity of the Memory exhaustion.
